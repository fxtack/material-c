# material-c
Material-c is the first completely project I created with spring boot. And it also is the works for computer application ability competition

This project is very rough because I do it while learning and lack of overall design. But this is a very successful project for me. It can not only be successfully deployed and run on the cloud server, but also I still use it as my private cloud disk.

I integrated a lot of my enthusiasm for technology into it.
This is my whole stack of works. The front end of the project is very chaotic and completely unmaintainable. Moreover, the UI is modified with a randomly found template. The back end also has many disadvantages. I am trying to improve these problems and launch a new version to revive this project.

Although this project is very bad, but I put it on GitHub to encourage myself and remind myself to avoid these problems in the future development of this project.

Thank you for reading this and wish you a good day. üòÉ
